# Code-for-Essays
The R code that I used in order to create the figures and tables in my published essays.

I continue to publish academic papers in the area of computational literary studies. It is good practice, I feel, to make the code that I have used to generate the material for such papers available for inspection. I code in R, and hope that in some small way my code will be useful to your own projects. Feel free to use the code in any way you see fit.

Note: code will be released as the papers are published.
